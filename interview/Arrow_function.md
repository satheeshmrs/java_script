# Arrow functions:
Arrow functions were introduced in the ES6 version of javascript. They provide us with a new and shorter syntax for declaring functions. Arrow functions can only be used as a function expression.

```javascript
// Traditional function expression
var multiplyBy2 = function(num){
  return num * 2;
}
// Arrow function expression
var arrowMultiplyBy2 = num => num * 2;
```
